<h1>The importance of registering <code>HttpClient</code></h1>
<p>In Blazor WebAssembly projects, it's essential to register <code>HttpClient</code> in order to perform server operations such as reading or writing files, accessing databases, and more. These operations must be performed at the API level, using technologies like ASP.NET Web API or ASP.NET gRPC Service. To use an API in a Blazor WebAssembly project, <code>HttpClient</code> registration is required.</p>
<p>The process for registering APIs in Blazor WebAssembly can vary depending on how the API is designed. Factors to consider include whether there is a single API server or multiple servers, how authorization is handled at the API level, and how errors are handled in the API. By understanding these factors, you can determine the appropriate method for registering APIs in your Blazor WebAssembly project.</p>
<hr class="my-4" />
<h1>How to register <code>HttpClient</code> for a single API</h1>
<p>If your website has only one API, you can add <code>HttpClient</code> as a scoped service in the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file. To do this, assuming your API endpoint is <strong>http://localhost:30911</strong>, use the following code:</p>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">builder.Services.AddScoped(sp =&gt; new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:30911") });</pre>
<p>Once registered, you can inject the <code>HttpClient</code> into any razor component to make a request. For example:</p>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@inject HttpClient HttpClient</pre>
<p>This will allow you to interact with your API from within your Blazor WebAssembly application.</p>
<hr class="my-4" />
<h1>How to register <code>HttpClient</code> for multiple APIs</h1>
<p>When working with multiple APIs in Blazor WebAssembly, there are several ways to register <code>HttpClient</code>, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The three most common approaches are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using a derived class of <code>HttpClient</code></li>
    <li>Using a named <code>HttpClient</code></li>
    <li>Using an <code>HttpClient</code> wrapper</li>
</ul>
<p>Each approach provides everything you need to interact with multiple APIs in your application, but the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of your project.</p>
<h3>Using a derived class of <code>HttpClient</code></h3>
<p><code>HttpClient</code> is a class that provides a simple API for sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses. In most scenarios, you can use <code>HttpClient</code> directly to interact with remote services and APIs.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, you may need to customize the behavior of <code>HttpClient</code>, such as adding custom headers, handling retries, or implementing a custom message handler. In these situations, you can derive a new class from <code>HttpClient</code> and add your custom logic to it.</p>
<p>Deriving a new class from <code>HttpClient</code> allows you to extend the functionality of <code>HttpClient</code> while still using its core features and avoiding the need to write all the low-level HTTP code yourself. Your derived class can inherit all the methods and properties of <code>HttpClient</code> and override or add new behavior as needed.</p>
<p>To create a derived class, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Define a new class that extends the <code>HttpClient</code> class and sets the <code>BaseAddress</code> property in its constructor. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">public class CustomHttpClient : HttpClient
{
    public CustomHttpClient()
    {
        BaseAddress = new("http://localhost:30911");
    }
}</pre>
<ol start="2">
    <li>Register the class as a scoped service in the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file, using the <code>AddScoped</code> method of the <code>IServiceCollection</code> interface. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;CustomHttpClient&gt;();</pre>
<ol start="3">
    <li>Whenever you need to make a request, you can inject the <code>CustomHttpClient</code> class using the <code>@inject</code> directive. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@inject CustomHttpClient CustomHttpClient</pre>
<h3>Using a named <code>HttpClient</code></h3>
<p>Named <code>HttpClient</code> is a feature that allows you to create and manage multiple instances of the <code>HttpClient</code> class or derived <code>HttpClient</code> classes, each with its own set of configurations and settings, and distinguish between them using a unique name.</p>
<p>This is useful when your application needs to interact with multiple remote services or APIs, each with different requirements and characteristics, such as different timeouts, headers, base addresses, or authentication credentials. By giving each <code>HttpClient</code> instance a name, you can easily refer to it when making HTTP requests, and the <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> will take care of creating and configuring the appropriate client for you.</p>
<p>To create named <code>HttpClient</code> instances, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Register your HttpClient instances in the Program.cs file and provide a unique name for each instance. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">builder.Services.AddHttpClient("First API", httpClient =&gt; httpClient.BaseAddress = new("http://localhost:30911"));
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("Second API", httpClient =&gt; httpClient.BaseAddress = new("http://localhost:30912"));</pre>
<ol start="2">
    <li>When making a request, inject the <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> interface and create an instance of <code>HttpClient</code> by specifying its name. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory

...

@code {
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("First API");
        ...
    }
}</pre>
<p>HttpClient wrapper is a design pattern used to wrap the HttpClient class in a custom class or interface to provide additional functionality or simplify its usage.</p>
<h3>Using an <code>HttpClient</code> wrapper</h3>
<p>By wrapping <code>HttpClient</code>, you can encapsulate its implementation details and provide a simpler, more focused API that is easier to use and test. This can be especially useful when you need to add common headers or handle errors in a consistent way across multiple requests.</p>
<p>To create an HttpClient wrapper, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a wrapper class that takes an instance of HttpClient as a dependency, like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">public class SecondApiHttpClientWrapper
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public SecondApiHttpClientWrapper(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }
}</pre>
<ol start="2">
    <li>Register the wrapper class with the dependency injection container in your <strong>Program.cs</strong>, like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">builder.Services.AddHttpClient&lt;SecondApiHttpClientWrapper&gt;(httpClient =&gt; httpClient.BaseAddress = new("http://localhost:30912"));</pre>
<ol start="3">
    <li>In your code, inject an instance of the wrapper class and use its methods to make requests, like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@inject SecondApiHttpClientWrapper SecondApiHttpClientWrapper</pre>
<hr class="my-4" />
<h1>Interfere <code>HttpClient</code></h1>
<p>Certain APIs require additional measures to interact with, such as protected JWT tokens, specific request headers, or loading indicators for requests and responses. In these cases, interfacing with <code>HttpClient</code> can be beneficial. There are several methods to interface with <code>HttpClient</code>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>HttpClient</code> middleware.</li>
    <li><code>HttpClient</code> wrapper.</li>
    <li><code>HttpClient</code> extension.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>HttpClient</code> middleware</h3>
<p>The <code>HttpClient</code> middleware technique is built on the chain of responsibility pattern, where multiple middlewares can be applied to an HTTP request and response in a specific order. The middleware chain starts with the first middleware and ends with the last middleware, processing the request and response respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\api-interaction-763318\httpclient-middleware-chain.png" alt="httpclient-middleware-chain.png" width="800" height="820" /></p>
<p>Follow these steps to create and use <code>HttpClient</code> middleware:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a middleware class that extends the DelegatingHandler class and overrides the <code>Send</code>/<code>SendAsync</code> method. Interfering code can be added before and after sending the request.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">public class FirstMiddleware : DelegatingHandler
{
    protected override async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Interfering code before sending the request
        var response = await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        // Interfering code after sending the request

        return response;
    }
}</pre>
<blockquote>It's important to call <code>base.Send()</code> or <code>base.SendAsync()</code> when overriding the <code>Send</code> or <code>SendAsync</code> method respectively, to ensure the middleware chain continues without being broken.</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
    <li>Register all the middlewares as transient services in the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;FirstMiddleware&gt;();
builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;SecondMiddleware&gt;();</pre>
<ol start="3">
    <li>Register the <code>HttpClient</code> by using named <code>HttpClient</code> or <code>HttpClient</code> wrapper technique, then add the middleware chain in your desired sequence.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">builder.Services.AddHttpClient("HttpClient with Middlewares", httpClient =&gt; httpClient.BaseAddress = new("http://localhost:30911"))
       .AddHttpMessageHandler&lt;FirstMiddleware&gt;()
       .AddHttpMessageHandler&lt;SecondMiddleware&gt;();

builder.Services.AddHttpClient&lt;SecondApiHttpClientWrapper&gt;(httpClient =&gt; httpClient.BaseAddress = new("http://localhost:30912"))
       .AddHttpMessageHandler&lt;FirstMiddleware&gt;()
       .AddHttpMessageHandler&lt;SecondMiddleware&gt;();</pre>
<h3><code>HttpClient</code> wrapper</h3>
<p><code>HttpClient</code> wrapper is another way to interfere with HTTP requests and responses. You can provide additional methods to the <code>HttpClient</code> wrapper to create a centralized interference code. Here is an example of how to create a method to send a request using a wrapper class:</p>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">public class InterfereByHttpClientWrapper
{
    ...
    public async Task&lt;T?&gt; GetAsync&lt;T&gt;(string requestUrl)
    {
        // Interfering code before sending the request
        var response = await _httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;T&gt;(requestUrl);
        // Interfering code after sending the request

        return response;
    }
}</pre>
<h3><code>HttpClient</code> extension</h3>
<p><code>HttpClient</code> extension is another way to interfere with HTTP requests and responses. It allows you to add custom methods and functionality to the <code>HttpClient</code> class.</p>
<p>To create a <code>HttpClient</code> extension, you can create a static class with extension methods for the <code>HttpClient</code> class. For example:</p>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">public static class HttpClientExtension
{
    public static async Task&lt;T?&gt; GetResponse&lt;T&gt;(this HttpClient httpClient, string url)
    {
        // Interfering code before sending the request
        var result = await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;T&gt;(url);
        // Interfering code after sending the request

        return result;
    }
}</pre>
<hr class="my-4" />
<h1>How to send requests and handle responses</h1>
<p>There are several common HTTP methods that are used to communicate with web servers. Here are some of the most common ones:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>GET: This method is used to retrieve information from the server. It is the most commonly used HTTP method and is used to fetch web pages, images, videos, and other resources from the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>POST: This method is used to submit data to the server. It is commonly used in web forms to send data to the server for processing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>PUT: This method is used to update or replace existing data on the server. It is commonly used in RESTful API's to update resources on the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>DELETE: This method is used to delete a resource from the server. It is commonly used in RESTful API's to delete resources.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>HEAD: This method is similar to the GET method, but it only retrieves the headers of the response, not the body. It is commonly used to check the status of a resource without downloading the entire response.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>OPTIONS: This method is used to retrieve the supported HTTP methods for a resource. It is commonly used in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to check whether a particular origin is allowed to access a resource.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>PATCH: This method is used to make partial updates to a resource. It is commonly used in RESTful API's to update specific fields of a resource without replacing the entire resource.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Sending data through a URL</h3>
<p>It is possible to send data to an API by including it in the URL, a commonly used method with the GET request. However, it is important to note that the data sent through the URL should be a short, primitive data type. It is not recommended to send large data sets through the URL. Instead, <code>HttpClient</code> can be utilized to send data through the URL, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">await httpClient.GetAsync($"example/ProcessPrimitiveUrlData?data=Blazor School");</pre>
<h3>Sending primitive data in the request body</h3>
<p>When sending primitive data in an HTTP request, the data can be included in the request body rather than in the URL. This is useful when the data being sent is larger or more complex than a simple query parameter. To send primitive data in the request body, the following code can be used:</p>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">await httpClient.PostAsync("example/ProcessPrimitiveData", new StringContent(""Blazor School"", Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));</pre>
<p>This will encode the data as a JSON string and send it to the specified API endpoint for processing.</p>
<h3>Sending complex data in the request body</h3>
<p>Sending complex data in the request body is a common practice in web development when exchanging data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. Complex data can include objects, arrays, and nested data structures.</p>
<p>When sending complex data in the request body, the data is usually serialized into a format that can be transmitted over the network. There are several formats for serializing data, including JSON, XML, and YAML, among others. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for serializing complex data, and it is supported by most modern web development frameworks.</p>
<p>There are several methods available in the <code>System.Net.Http.Json</code> namespace that can assist in sending complex data in the request body. As an example, the following code snippet demonstrates the usage of the <code>PostAsJsonAsync</code> method to send a complex object in the request body:</p>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">var data = new ExampleClass()
{
    ExampleString = "Blazor School"
};
await httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync&lt;ExampleClass&gt;("example/ProcessComplexData", data);</pre>
<h3>Sending stream data in the request body</h3>
<p>Sending stream data in the request body is a technique used to transmit large or continuous data streams from the client to the server over an HTTP connection. This technique is commonly used in scenarios where data is generated or consumed in real-time, such as video streaming, file uploading, or real-time sensor data.</p>
<p>When sending stream data in the request body, the client typically uses the HTTP POST method to send a series of data chunks to the server. The data chunks are sent in a continuous stream, without waiting for a response from the server after each chunk is sent.</p>
<p>The most common use case for sending stream data is to upload a file to an API. In Blazor, the <code>InputFile</code> component can be used to prompt the user to select a file. The selected file is then mapped to the <code>IBrowserFile</code> interface by the <code>InputFile</code> component. The file can be converted to <code>StreamContent</code> and sent to the server using the <code>HttpClient</code> class. Here is an example of how to upload a file to an API using the <code>InputFile</code> component in Blazor:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a form model. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">public class ExampleFormModel
{
    public IBrowserFile ExampleFile { get; set; } = default!;
}</pre>
<ol start="2">
    <li>Use the <code>InputFile</code> component:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory

&lt;EditForm Model="FormModel" OnSubmit="SubmitFormAsync"&gt;
    &lt;InputFile OnChange="FileChanged" /&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/EditForm&gt;

@code {
    public ExampleFormModel FormModel { get; set; } = new();

    public void FileChanged(InputFileChangeEventArgs args)
    {
        FormModel.ExampleFile = args.File;
    }

    public async Task SubmitFormAsync()
    {
        var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("Second API");
        using var formDataContent = new MultipartFormDataContent();
        using var stream = FormModel.ExampleFile.OpenReadStream(long.MaxValue);
        using var streamContent = new StreamContent(stream);
        streamContent.Headers.ContentType = new(FormModel.ExampleFile.ContentType);
        formDataContent.Add(streamContent, "FileStream", FormModel.ExampleFile.Name);
        var message = await httpClient.PostAsync("example/ProcessStreamdata", formDataContent);
        // Further logic
    }
}</pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>formDataContent</code> only contains a single file. However, you can add multiple files to the <code>formDataContent</code> by calling the <code>Add</code> method on the content object multiple times, each time with a different file and a unique name. This way, you can send multiple files in a single request to the server.</p>
<h3>Handling primitive data in the response</h3>
<p>After sending a request to the API, the API will process the request and return a response to the <code>HttpClient</code>. Sometimes, the response will contain data, while other times it won't. To handle a response that contains data, you can use the following code:</p>
<pre class="code" language="csharp">var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("example/ReturnPrimitiveData");

if(response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    DataReceived = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
}
else
{
    DataReceived = "Failed";
}</pre>
<h3>Automatically deserialize response data to object using Microsoft library</h3>
<p>You can automatically deserialize JSON response data to a C# object using the Microsoft library <code>System.Net.Http.Json</code>. This library leverages <code>System.Text.Json</code> to handle the deserialization. Here's an example implementation:</p>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory

&lt;div&gt;Data Received: @ExampleInstance.ExampleString&lt;/div&gt;

@code {
    public ExampleClass ExampleInstance { get; set; } = new();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("Second API");
        ExampleInstance = await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;ExampleClass&gt;("example/ReturnComplexData") ?? new();
    }
}</pre>
<h3>Deserialize response data to object using Newtonsoft library</h3>
<p>Newtonsoft.Json is a popular third-party library for working with JSON data in .NET applications. It provides a comprehensive set of classes and methods for serializing and deserializing JSON data to and from .NET objects, as well as working with JSON documents directly. Newtonsoft.Json is often considered more user-friendly and flexible than System.Text.Json, with a wider range of configuration options and a more intuitive API. Here's an example implementation:</p>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@using Newtonsoft.Json
@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory

&lt;div&gt;Data Received: @ExampleInstance.ExampleString&lt;/div&gt;

@code {
    public ExampleClass ExampleInstance { get; set; } = new();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("Second API");
        var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("example/ReturnComplexData");

        if(response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            ExampleInstance = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;ExampleClass&gt;(responseContent) ?? new();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>To avoid repeating the same code, you can follow one of the techniques in the <strong>Interfere HttpClient</strong> section.</p>
<h3>Handling stream data in the response</h3>
<p>When an API returns a stream, you can process it using the <code>ReadAsStreamAsync()</code> method. Here's an example code that processes an image file stream:</p>
<pre class="code" language="razor">@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory

&lt;img src="@ImageSrc"/&gt;

@code {
    public string ImageSrc { get; set; } = "";

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient("Second API");
        var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("example/ReturnStreamData");

        if(response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            using var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
            byte[] buffer = new byte[stream.Length];
            await stream.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, (int)stream.Length);
            string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(buffer);
            ImageSrc = $"data:image/png;base64,{base64}";
        }

        StateHasChanged();
    }
}</pre>
<blockquote>Note that you need to process the stream according to its type, and it may not always be an image file stream as in the example.</blockquote>

<h1>Key differences between Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server</h1>
<p>In Blazor WebAssembly, requests are sent from the browser, and they can contain client-side information such as cookies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in Blazor Server, requests are sent from the server, and they do not contain client-side information.</p>
