<h1>Component interaction</h1>
<p>✅ Similar to Blazor Server</p>
<p>Building a real-world Blazor application often involves creating hundreds of small components that work together to solve a specific problem. Effective communication and collaboration between these components is crucial for the success of the project. This tutorial will explore various methods for interacting between components and guide you in selecting the most appropriate approach for your needs. You will learn how to share information and how to ensure that components react to changes in shared data.</p>

<h1>Sharing data approaches</h1>
<p>In Blazor, data can be shared between components using three approaches:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>CascadingParameter</code>.</li>
    <li><code>Parameter</code>.</li>
    <li>Transfer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to understand how to pass data between components, how to receive updates when the shared data is modified, and common mistakes to avoid when using all the three approaches,</p>

<h1>Selecting an appropriate approach</h1>
<p>Choosing the appropriate technique for interacting between components can be challenging due to the variety of options available. It's important to remember that each technique serves a specific purpose and the best choice will depend on the structure of your component tree. A component tree is a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of components in a web application, showing the parent-child relationship. Understanding your component tree can guide the selection of the most appropriate technique for your use case.</p>
<h3><code>CascadingParameter</code> approach</h3>
<p><code>CascadingParameter</code> is a feature in Blazor that allows passing data from an ancestor component to its descendant components in a hierarchical structure. It is not able to pass data between sibling components. The following image illustrates how data flows through a component tree using <code>CascadingParameter</code>:</p>

<h3><code>Parameter</code> approach</h3>
<p><code>Parameter</code> is a feature for transmitting data from a parent component to its direct child components. However, it is essential to note that this approach does not allow passing data to sibling components or the children of the direct child. The following image illustrates how data flows through a component tree using <code>Parameter</code>:</p>

<h3>Transfer service approach</h3>
<p>Transfer service is a useful approach when you want all of your components to share a common data source or adopt a "single source of truth" approach. It is not restricted by the component tree and can pass data across all components within your website. The following image illustrates how data flows through a component tree using transfer service:</p>
