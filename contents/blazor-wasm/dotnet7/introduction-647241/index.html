<h1>The learning path of Blazor WebAssembly</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Debugging: Start by learning how to set breakpoints, step through code, and use the developer tools in your browser to debug Blazor applications.</li>
    <li>Components: Learn how to create reusable components in Blazor, including how to pass data between components and how to use component parameters. Additionally, learn about the component lifecycle, including the various lifecycle methods that are available (such as OnInit, OnParametersSet, OnAfterRender, etc.) and when they are executed. Understand how to use these lifecycle methods to perform tasks such as data binding and initialization, and how they can be used to improve performance. Also learn how to use routes parameters to navigate between components, this include how to define routes, how to navigate to them and how to access the parameters from the component.</li>
    <li>Directives: Learn about the different types of directives available in Blazor, including how to use them to add additional behavior to a component, such as event handling. Understand how directives interact with the component's lifecycle and how they can be used to interact with the DOM.</li>
    <li>JavaScript interaction: Learn how to interact with JavaScript code from a Blazor app, including how to call JavaScript functions from C# code and how to handle JavaScript events in a Blazor component.</li>
    <li>Dependency injection: Learn how to handle logic, it is important to create and use services in Blazor. These services can be injected into components through dependency injection, which is a design pattern that allows for loose coupling of components.</li>
    <li>Using form: Create and handle forms in Blazor, implement form validation using built-in validation attributes and custom validation logic.</li>
    <li>API interaction: Learn how to use third-party APIs, you will need to learn how to make HTTP requests using the <code>HttpClient</code> class. This allows you to interact with the API and retrieve or send data.</li>
    <li>Authentication and authorization: To display the website differently for each user, you will need to understand how to implement authentication and authorization in Blazor. This includes securing routes and displaying different content based on the user's role.</li>
    <li>Browser storage: To store and retrieve data in the browser, you will need to learn about browser storage options such as LocalStorage and SessionStorage.</li>
    <li>Handle errors: Learn how to handle errors and exceptions in a Blazor application, and display user-friendly error messages.</li>
    <li>Deploy and hosting: Finally, to make your application available to users, you will need to learn how to deploy and host your Blazor WebAssembly website on a web server or cloud service. This includes configuring the server and setting up necessary security measures.</li>
