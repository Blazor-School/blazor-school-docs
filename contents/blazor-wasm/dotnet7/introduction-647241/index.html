<h1>The essential knowledge needed</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Debugging: To debug a Blazor WebAssembly website, you will need to familiarize yourself with the different debugging tools available, such as the browser's developer tools and C# debugging tools like Visual Studio. This will enable you to identify and resolve errors in the code.</li>
    <li>Components: Understanding the lifecycle of a Blazor component is crucial. This includes knowing when certain methods are called and how to interact with other components through properties and events. Additionally, you should be able to define routes and parameters for navigation and use content projection to insert content inside a component.</li>
    <li>Directives: Blazor allows for seamless interaction between C# and JavaScript code. This includes the ability to call JavaScript functions from C# and vice versa.</li>
    <li>JavasScript interaction: from C# calls JavaScript and vice versa.</li>
    <li>Dependency injection: To handle logic, it is important to create and use services in Blazor. These services can be injected into components through dependency injection, which is a design pattern that allows for loose coupling of components.</li>
    <li>Using form: To collect user information, you will need to become proficient in building forms in Blazor.</li>
    <li>API interaction: To use third-party APIs, you will need to learn how to make HTTP requests using the <code>HttpClient</code> class. This will allow you to interact with the API and retrieve or send data.</li>
    <li>Authentication and authorization: To display the website differently for each user, you will need to understand how to implement authentication and authorization in Blazor. This includes securing routes and displaying different content based on the user's role.</li>
    <li>Browser storage: To store and retrieve data in the browser, you will need to learn about browser storage options such as LocalStorage and SessionStorage.</li>
    <li>Handle errors: To create a robust application, it is essential to handle errors in a graceful manner. This includes catching and handling exceptions, displaying appropriate error messages, and logging errors..</li>
    <li>Deploy and hosting: Finally, to make your application available to users, you will need to learn how to deploy and host your Blazor WebAssembly website on a web server or cloud service. This includes configuring the server and setting up necessary security measures.</li>
