<h1>What is publishing, deployment, and hosting?</h1>
<p>Publishing, deployment, and hosting are 3 steps to make a website available, respectively.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Publishing</strong>: The process of compiling your website into files that are executable by the host machine's OS (Windows, Linux).</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: The process of bringing/copy the published files into the host machine.</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting</strong>: The process of setting up the host machine and make it available to the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>For some hosting methods, you will see some steps are merged together. For example, if you host your website by Azure App Service, you will only see the publishing process and the rest are taken care by Azure and Visual Studio.</p>
