<p>We would like to extend our gratitude to Grimston#0001, a Discord user from <a href="https://npipes.net/aff.php?aff=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="NPipes">NPipes</a> who sponsored a VPS machine for creating this tutorial. You too can contribute to the community.</p>
<p>Please note that this tutorial does not cover deploying a website API, but you can use the same VPS to host your website API.</p>
<hr class="my-4" />
<h1>Required tools</h1>
<p>In order to manage your Linux VPS, you will need two tools: one for executing commands and one for transferring files between your computer and the VPS machine. We recommend using Bitvise SSH Client, which is an all-in-one tool for these tasks.</p>
<hr class="my-4" />
<h1>Publishing a Blazor WebAssembly website</h1>
<p>Before deploying your website to a Linux VPS, you will need to publish it to a folder. This will allow us to make the website functional and then set up a GitHub action for automated deployment later. To publish your website to a folder, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click on your Blazor WebAssembly project and select <strong>Publish...</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\publishing-blazor-webassembly-1.png" alt="publishing-blazor-webassembly-1.png" width="426" height="366" /></p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>In the next step, select <strong>Folder</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\publishing-blazor-webassembly-2.png" alt="publishing-blazor-webassembly-2.png" width="804" height="564" /></p>
<ol start="3">
    <li>Choose the folder location where you want to publish the website.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\publishing-blazor-webassembly-3.png" alt="publishing-blazor-webassembly-3.png" width="804" height="564" /></p>
<ol start="4">
    <li>Click <strong>Publish</strong> to start the publishing process.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\publishing-blazor-webassembly-4.png" alt="publishing-blazor-webassembly-4.png" width="800" height="283" /></p>
<p>Once the website is published to the folder, you can test it out locally to ensure it is working as intended. If any changes are needed, make them and republish the website to the folder until you are satisfied with the results.</p>

<h1>Speeding up your Blazor WebAssembly website</h1>
<p>Here are some suggestions to speed up your website hosting:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS and ensure that your SSL certificate is properly installed and configured.</li>
    <li>Verify that MIME types are being handled correctly.</li>
    <li>Activate gzip compression to reduce the size of your web pages and accelerate their loading time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Redirect HTTP to HTTPS</h3>
<p>To enable HTTP to HTTPS redirection, simply follow the tutorial provided. In the example, the second server block performs the redirection automatically, so there's no need to worry about it.</p>
<h3>Verify that MIME types are being handled correctly</h3>
<p>Handling MIME types is a matter of assigning file extensions to their respective categories. For instance, files ending with <strong>.css</strong> should be identified as <code>text/css</code>. Since there are numerous MIME types available, they must be recognized accurately. A comprehensive list of MIME types is available on <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="IANA Media Types">IANA Media Types</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure that all of your files are being processed appropriately, navigate to the <strong>/etc/nginx/mime.types</strong> file on your VPS server. If a particular MIME type is not listed, you must add it manually and reload the NGINX server.</p>
<h3>Activate gzip compression</h3>
<p>Enabling gzip compression can significantly improve your website's loading speed by reducing its weight. When you activate gzip, NGINX uses some CPU power to compress your website before sending it to the browser. The browser then decompresses the website for display. Since compressing and decompressing are less expensive than transportation costs, this technique can boost loading speed.</p>
<p>However, gzip can be tricky to use if you are unfamiliar with it. To apply it correctly, you must determine when to compress and when not to. Gzip is already enabled in NGINX by default settings. You can find these settings in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf by looking for the # Gzip Settings. To activate advanced settings, uncomment all other settings. Your Gzip settings should resemble the following:</p>
<pre class="code" language="yml">gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_proxied any;
gzip_comp_level 6;
gzip_buffers 16 8k;
gzip_http_version 1.1;
gzip_types
    text/plain
    text/css
    application/json
    application/javascript
    text/xml
    application/xml
    application/xml+rss
    text/javascript;</pre>
<p>The <code>gzip_types</code> list specifies which MIME types to compress for a smaller size, and you can add more to it.</p>
<p>The <code>gzip_comp_level</code> determines the level of compression, ranging from 1 to 9, with 1 being the least compressed and 9 being the most compressed. Higher compression levels compensate for more CPU usage, but sometimes the output size can be bigger than the original.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, some files may become larger after being compressed. You can add <code>gzip_min_length X</code> to tell NGINX not to compress files smaller than <code>X</code>. There is no ideal number for this setting, so you must monitor your website and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>To see gzip's effectiveness, open your website, turn on the <strong>Web Developer Tools</strong> by pressing <strong>F12</strong>, and open the <strong>Network</strong> tab. Check the <strong>Disable Cache</strong> option and reload the website.</p>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\speed-up-blazor-webassembly-1.png" alt="speed-up-blazor-webassembly-1.png" width="800" height="419" /></p>
<p>If the size before compression is larger than the size after compression, then you should compress the file. Otherwise, you should not compress it (either remove the <code>gzip_types</code> or increase the <code>gzip_min_length X</code>).</p>

<h1>Configuring a GitHub action</h1>
<p>Congratulations on having a healthy website up and running! To simplify the process of deploying website updates, the next step is to set up a deployment pipeline. GitHub is a great tool to help you do this.</p>
<p>To get started, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In your GitHub repository, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Secrets &gt; Actions</strong> and click <strong>New repository secret</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\set-up-github-action-1.png" alt="set-up-github-action-1.png" width="800" height="550" /></p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>Create 3 secret keys for the host address, username, and password to log into your VPS machine.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\set-up-github-action-2.png" alt="set-up-github-action-2.png" width="804" height="452" /></p>
<ol start="3">
    <li>Switch to the <strong>Actions</strong> tab and click <strong>New workflow</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\set-up-github-action-3.png" alt="set-up-github-action-3.png" width="700" height="107" /></p>
<ol start="4">
    <li>Search for the <strong>ASP.NET</strong> workflow and select <strong>.NET</strong> by <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="\tutorials\legacy-contents\blazor-wasm\dotnet7\linux-vps-hosting-with-deployment-pipeline-572951\set-up-github-action-4.png" alt="set-up-github-action-4.png" width="800" height="339" /></p>
<ol start="5">
    <li>Update the YAML file with your information. Here's an example file:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="code" language="yml">name: Deploy to VPS
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master
env:
  CONFIGURATION: Release
  DOTNET_CORE_VERSION: 7.x.x
  GITHUB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: blazorschool.&lt;your_website&gt;
  VPS_WEB_DIRECTORY: /home/blazor school.&lt;your_website&gt;
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup .NET Core
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: ${{ env.DOTNET_CORE_VERSION }}
    - name: Restore web
      run: dotnet restore
    - name: Build web
      run: dotnet build --configuration ${{ env.CONFIGURATION }} --no-restore
    - name: Test web
      run: dotnet test --no-build
    - name: Publish web
      run: dotnet publish --configuration ${{ env.CONFIGURATION }} --output "${{ env.GITHUB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY }}"

    - name: Copy web via ssh
      uses: garygrossgarten/github-action-scp@master
      with:
        local: ${{ env.GITHUB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY }}
        remote: ${{ env.VPS_WEB_DIRECTORY }}
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}</pre>
<p>Remember to replace the placeholders with your own information. The <code>GITHUB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</code> can be anything, but the <code>VPS_WEB_DIRECTORY</code> needs to exist before running the workflow. The <code>on</code> key determines when to deploy the website, and in this example, it's set to deploy on every push to the master branch.</p>
<p>Don't forget to update the secret keys in the <code>Copy web via ssh</code> job as well. With this deployment pipeline in place, you'll be able to update your website more easily and efficiently!</p>

<h1>Common mistakes</h1>
<p>In this section, we've gathered some common mistakes that members of the Blazor School Discord community have encountered.</p>
<h3>Mistake #1: Letting NGINX handle errors</h3>
<p>Don't make the mistake of letting NGINX handle errors like 404. Instead, let Blazor handle all errors so that you have a professional-looking error page, and your error handling code will work correctly. Here's an example of what not to do:</p>
<pre class="code" language="yml">// DON'T DO THIS
location / 
{ 
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404; 
}</pre>
<h3>Mistake #2: Not serving index.html as a backup</h3>
<p>If you don't serve <strong>index.html</strong> as a backup, your website won't be accessible through sub-URLs and can only be accessed through the homepage. For example, if you access your website via <code>https://208.115.245.90/product-list</code>, you'll get a 404 error. Here's an example of what not to do:</p>
<pre class="code" language="yml">// DON'T DO THIS
location / 
{ 
    try_files /index.html; 
}</pre>
<h3>Mistake #3: Case sensitivity with files</h3>
<p>By default, NGINX is case-sensitive when searching for files. So if you're trying to access a file named <strong>wwwroot/Logo.png</strong> but you type <strong>&lt;your_website&gt;.com/logo.png</strong>, you'll get a 404 error because the file name should be <strong>wwwroot/Logo.png</strong>.</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: Storing dynamic files in the wwwroot folder</h3>
<p>Don't store dynamic files like user avatars or user-uploaded files in the <strong>wwwroot</strong> folder. The <strong>wwwroot</strong> folder should only contain static files. This makes it easier to deploy your website to multiple servers and maintain backups.</p>
