<h1>What are publishing, deployment, and hosting?</h1>
<p>To make a website available, there are three essential steps: publishing, deployment, and hosting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Publishing involves compiling your website into files that can be executed by the host machine's operating system, such as Windows or Linux.</li>
    <li>Deployment involves copying the published files onto the host machine.</li>
    <li>Hosting refers to the process of setting up the host machine and making it available on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that some hosting methods may combine these steps. For example, if you choose to host your website using Azure App Service, you'll only need to go through the publishing process, as Azure and Visual Studio will take care of the rest.</p>

<h1>Essential and optional services</h1>
<p>When preparing to launch a website, you'll need to consider several essential services:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Domain</strong>: This is the web address for your site. You can use a subdomain if you already have a domain. For example: blazorschool.com or mail.google.com.</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting Machine</strong>: This is the server that will execute the business logic of your website. Examples include a virtual machine, Azure App Service, or Azure Functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also additional services you may want to consider to enhance your website's functionality:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>File Serving Service</strong>: This service helps you serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at a low cost and high speed. Examples include Azure Static Web App and Azure CDN.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Storage</strong>: This service provides a place to store and manage your website's data. Examples include Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, or a virtual machine.</li>
    <li><strong>SSL</strong>: This service helps to make your website secure and trusted.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Cost estimates (as of 2023)</h1>
<p>To keep your website up and running, you'll need to pay for various services on a monthly basis. The cost of hosting a website can range from just a few dollars to thousands of dollars per month, depending on the type of website you have.</p>
<p>For static websites, the cost of hosting can be as low as a few cents to a few dollars per month. However, for dynamic websites that require more resources, the cost can increase significantly.</p>
<p>In general, Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting and static web host are more affordable hosting options, while dedicated hosting tends to be more expensive. On the other hand, using Azure services can be more expensive due to the premium features and managed services that it offers.</p>
<p>It's important to consider your website's specific needs and budget when choosing a hosting service. Cost is one factor to consider, but other factors such as reliability, security, and customer support should also be taken into account.</p>
