<h1>The Learning Path of Blazor Web App</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Render modes: Control how your web app is rendered.</li>
    <li>Components: Components are the backbone of Blazor. You will learn how to share data between components, their lifecycle, and their purpose.</li>
    <li>Directives: A fixed set of attributes that change the behavior of your components. There is a wide set of directives in Blazor, each serving a different purpose.</li>
    <li>JavaScript interaction: Learn how to interact with JavaScript code from Blazor, including calling C# and JavaScript methods back and forth.</li>
    <li>Dependency injection: Learn about state management in Blazor. Understanding dependency injection in Blazor will also help you create a better project structure.</li>
    <li>Using forms: Collect and validate data from users.</li>
    <li>Integrate with third-party APIs: Learn to integrate any third-party API into your web app.</li>
    <li>Authentication and authorization: Determine who the user is and display web content differently to each user based on their role or by using a policy for complex business logic.</li>
    <li>Browser storage: Browsers provide different kinds of storage, each with its own lifetime for different purposes. Learn how to interact with browser storage in Blazor.</li>
    <li>Error handling: Websites can produce errors due to user actions or inadequate business handling by developers. Blazor can help record user activity and handle errors accordingly, making the website more user-friendly than showing meaningless errors.</li>
    <li>Deploy and hosting: The final step of developing a website. Once deployed, users can access your website from their devices.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Course Structure</h1>
<p>Previously, we mixed concepts and implementation together. In this course, we will use a new approach that separates concepts from implementation. Hopefully, this will help you understand the course thoroughly. Inherently, in every tutorial, there will be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Concept explanation: This provides a clear and concise overview of the concept being covered, including relevant background information and key terms. This includes screenshots, images, or videos to help you understand the concept better.</li>
    <li>Code sample: A code sample is provided to demonstrate the concept in action. The code sample is well-commented and easy to understand.</li>
    <li>A fully working project example: A complete working project example that showcases the concept being covered. This allows you to see how the concept is implemented in a real-world scenario and provides an opportunity for you to experiment with the code.</li>
    <li>Common mistakes: A section discussing common mistakes that people make when implementing the concept can help you avoid these pitfalls and improve your understanding of the material.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What Comes After This Course?</h1>
<p>After this course, you will understand all aspects of Blazor and be able to develop any Blazor website with ease. However, the learning path is limitless. You can dive deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement more advanced features with Blazor.
