<h1>Introduction to Blazor WebAssembly Standalone</h1>
<p>Blazor WebAssembly Standalone is a new project template introduced in .NET 8. It enables developers to build web applications using Blazor syntax to generate and update HTML directly from the browser. This approach allows for a fully client-side experience, leveraging the power of WebAssembly to execute .NET code within the browser.</p>

<h1>Difference Between Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor WebAssembly Standalone</h1>
<p>Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor WebAssembly Standalone are both project templates under the Blazor framework. There is no fundamental difference between them in terms of functionality. Developers can create a Blazor WebAssembly project and change the target framework to .NET 9 if needed. However, for new projects, it is recommended to use the Blazor WebAssembly Standalone template for better compatibility and ease of setup.</p>

<h1>When to Use Blazor WebAssembly Standalone?</h1>
<p>Blazor WebAssembly Standalone provides unique advantages that make it suitable for specific scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Offline Availability</strong> &ndash; Since the application runs entirely in the browser, it can function without an internet connection once loaded.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Static Site Generation (SSG)</strong> &ndash; The application can be hosted as a static site, reducing server costs and improving performance.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Large Initial Load</strong> &ndash; The application requires downloading the WebAssembly runtime, which can lead to higher load times.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Limited Library Support</strong> &ndash; Running inside a WebAssembly sandbox restricts certain libraries and prevents full compatibility with server-side features.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Single-Threaded Execution</strong> &ndash; Since WebAssembly in the browser runs on a single thread, performing heavy tasks can freeze the UI.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>API Communication</strong>&ndash; Data must be exchanged with the backend using JSON, which can introduce additional overhead.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
